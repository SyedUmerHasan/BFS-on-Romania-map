# Artificial-Intelligence-Based-BFS-on-Romania-map

The map is directly taken up from your book together with the heuristics table. The task is to reach from
Arad to Bucharest using different strategies. Following are the strategies to be implemented.
a) BFS
b) DFS
c) A* algorithm
A comparison of these three has to be done. Path cost of each algorithm has to be calculated so that it
shows clearly that which algorithm is best out of all in ascending order.
